# Graph-Coloring-Problem

The Graph Coloring Problem consists of assigning colors to the elements of a graph subject to certain restrictions. In this code, a genetic algorithm is used to solve the problem and find the minimum number of colors required to color a graph.

This repo contains the code in python as a jupyter notebook and as a .py file. Also Here you can find a document describing the project in Spanish.
